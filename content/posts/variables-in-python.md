In programming, a variable is a storage location that is used to hold a value. This value can be a number, a string of text, or a complex data type such as a list or dictionary. Variables are useful because they allow us to store and manipulate data within our programs.

In Python, declaring a variable is as simple as assigning a value to it. For example:

```

`x = 5
message = "Hello World"`

```

Here, we have created two variables: `x` and `message`. The first variable, `x`, is assigned the value of 5 and the second variable, `message`, is assigned the string "Hello World".

It is important to note that Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that we do not need to specify the data type of a variable when we declare it. This is in contrast to languages like C++ or Java, which require us to specify the data type of a variable when it is declared.

Once a variable has been assigned a value, we can access and modify it later in our program. For example:

```

`x = 5
print(x)
x = 10
print(x)`
```

In this code, the first line assigns the value 5 to the variable `x`. The second line prints the value of `x` to the console, which would output 5. The third line then reassigns the value 10 to `x`, and the fourth line prints the new value of `x`, which would output 10.

It is also possible to perform operations on variables. For example:

```

`x = 5
y = 3
z = x + y
print(z)`

```

In this code, we have created three variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`. `x` is assigned the value 5 and `y` is assigned the value 3. We then perform the operation `x + y` and assign the result to the variable `z`. Finally, we print the value of `z`, which would output 8.

In addition to numbers and strings, Python also supports more complex data types such as lists and dictionaries. A list is an ordered collection of items, while a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.

For example:

```
`my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`
```

Here, we have created a list and a dictionary and assigned them to the variables `my_list` and `my_dict`, respectively. We can access and modify the items in these data types using indexing and key-value notation, respectively.

In conclusion, variables are a fundamental concept in programming that allow us to store and manipulate data within our programs. Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that we do not need to specify the data type of a variable when we declare it. We can perform operations on variables and access and modify the items in complex data types such as lists and dictionaries.
